When you type the following in your developer console:

a = {};
b = {};
a.__proto__ = b;
b.__proto__ = a;

You get the following exception:

    Uncaught TypeError: Cyclic __proto__ value


a) Explain what this exception means.
b) Why does this exception exist? What's wrong with a cyclic __proto__ value?
