Define a Rectangle class that extends the Shape class
Then create an instance of the Rectangle class
Then call the toString method on the new instance and print it out

class Shape {
    constructor(shapeName) {
        this.shapeName = shapeName;
    }
    toString() {
        return this.shapeName + " with area " +
          this.area() + " and perimeter " + this.perimeter();
    }
}
